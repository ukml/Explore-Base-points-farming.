# MyCryptoNotes

Hey, I'm beginner in crypto and Base chain. This repo is my spot to collect easy notes and ideas. Feel free to suggest improvements!

## Why I Started This
- Crypto seems exciting but overwhelming.
- Base chain is cheap and fun for newbies (like farming points we talked about).
- Goal: Learn step-by-step and maybe contribute to bigger projects.

## My First Notes
1. **What is Base?** It's a fast, low-cost blockchain built on Ethereum. Great for apps and games.
2. **Simple Tip:** Use wallets like Coinbase Wallet to start—no big money needed.
3. **Next Goal:** Try a small points farm script (inspired by easy guides).
